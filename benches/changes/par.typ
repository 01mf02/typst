It is not certain where in the UK she was born, although the Dover Express
in 1866 described her as a 'Scotch lady'. The 1871 census, however, shows
her living with an adopted 18-year-old child, Rosetta Vincent, and a married
sister, Emma Henley, in Ordsall near Retford and describing herself as a ‘lecturer’,
born in London. By 1881 she is in Clifton, Bristol, and in the census she
describes herself as a London-born, ‘Lecturer on Social Subjects’.

She reportedly had a seafaring father from the Scottish Highlands,
who died when she was an infant, and a mother who was an Italian actress.
As a child she appeared on the stage and this may have given her the skills
and the confidence for paid public speaking.
