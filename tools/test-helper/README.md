# Test helper

This is a small VS Code extension that helps with managing Typst's test suite.
When installed, three new buttons appear in the menubar for all `.typ` files in
the `tests` folder.

- Open: Opens the output and reference images of a test to the side.
- Refresh: Refreshes the preview.
- Rerun: Re-runs the test.
- Approve: Copies the output into the reference folder and optimizes
  it with `oxipng`.
