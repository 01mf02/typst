# Overview
Welcome to Typst's documentation! Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system for the sciences. It is designed to be an alternative both to advanced tools like LaTeX and simpler tools like Word and Google Docs. Typst's focus lies on the intersection of simplicity and power. We are building a highly capable tool that is at the same time easy to understand and use.

This documentation is split into two parts: A beginner-friendly tutorial that introduces Typst through a practical use case and a comprehensive reference that explains all of Typst's concepts and features.

We also invite you to join the community we're building around Typst. Typst is still a very young project, so your feedback is more than valuable.
