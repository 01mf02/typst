# Changelog
## Unreleased
- Added [`panic`]($func/panic) function
- Added [`clusters`]($type/string.clusters) and [`codepoints`]($type/string.codepoints)
  methods for strings
- Support for multiple authors in [`set document`]($func/document.author)
- Fixed crash when string is accessed at a position that is not a char boundary
- Fixed semicolon parsing in `[#var ;]`
- Fixed incremental parsing when inserting backslash at end of `[#"abc"]`
- Fixed names of a few font families
  (including Noto Sans Symbols and New Computer Modern families)
- Fixed autocompletion for font families
- Improved incremental compilation for user-defined functions

## February 15, 2023
- [Box]($func/box) and [block]($func/block) have gained `fill`, `stroke`,
  `radius`, and `inset` properties
- Blocks may now be explicitly sized, fixed-height blocks can still break
  across pages
- Blocks can now be configured to be [`breakable`]($func/block.breakable) or not
- [Numbering style]($func/enum.numbering) can now be configured for nested enums
- [Markers]($func/list.marker) can now be configured for nested lists
- The [`eval`]($func/eval) function now expects code instead of markup and
  returns an arbitrary value. Markup can still be evaluated by surrounding the
  string with brackets.
- PDFs generated by Typst now contain XMP metadata
- Link boxes are now disabled in PDF output
- Tables don't produce small empty cells before a pagebreak anymore
- Fixed raw block highlighting bug

## February 12, 2023
- Shapes, images, and transformations (move/rotate/scale/repeat) are now
  block-level. To integrate them into a paragraph, use a [`box`]($func/box) as
  with other elements.
- A colon is now required in an "everything" show rule: Write `{show: it => ..}`
  instead of `{show it => ..}`. This prevents intermediate states that ruin
  your whole document.
- Non-math content like a shape or table in a math formula is now centered
  vertically
- Support for widow and orphan prevention within containers
- Support for [RTL]($func/text.dir) in lists, grids, and tables
- Support for explicit `{auto}` sizing for boxes and shapes
- Support for fractional (i.e. `{1fr}`) widths for boxes
- Fixed bug where columns jump to next page
- Fixed bug where list items have no leading
- Fixed relative sizing in lists, squares and grid auto columns
- Fixed relative displacement in [`place`]($func/place) function
- Fixed that lines don't have a size
- Fixed bug where `{set document(..)}` complains about being after content
- Fixed parsing of `{not in}` operation
- Fixed hover tooltips in math
- Fixed bug where a heading show rule may not contain a pagebreak when an
  outline is present
- Added [`baseline`]($func/box.baseline) property on [`box`]($func/box)
- Added [`tg`]($func/op) and [`ctg`]($func/op) operators in math
- Added delimiter setting for [`cases`]($func/cases) function
- Parentheses are now included when accepting a function autocompletion

## February 2, 2023
- Merged text and math symbols, renamed a few symbols
  (including `infty` to `infinity` with the alias `oo`)
- Fixed missing italic mappings
- Math italics correction is now applied properly
- Parentheses now scale in `[$zeta(x/2)$]`
- Fixed placement of large root index
- Fixed spacing in `[$abs(-x)$]`
- Fixed inconsistency between text and identifiers in math
- Accents are now ignored when positioning superscripts
- Fixed vertical alignment in matrices
- Fixed `text` set rule in `raw` show rule
- Heading and list markers now parse consistently
- Allow arbitrary math directly in content

## January 30, 2023
[Go to the announcement blog post.](https://typst.app/blog/2023/january-update)
- New expression syntax in markup/math
  - Blocks cannot be directly embedded in markup anymore
  - Like other expressions, they now require a leading hashtag
  - More expressions available with hashtag, including literals
    (`[#"string"]`) as well as field access and method call
    without space: `[#emoji.face]`
- New import syntax
  - `[#import "module.typ"]` creates binding named `module`
  - `[#import "module.typ": a, b]` or `[#import "module.typ": *]` to import items
  - `[#import emoji: face, turtle]` to import from already bound module
- New symbol handling
  - Removed symbol notation
  - Symbols are now in modules: `{sym}`, `{emoji}`, and `{math}`
  - Math module also reexports all of `{sym}`
  - Modified through field access, still order-independent
  - Unknown modifiers are not allowed anymore
  - Support for custom symbol definitions with `symbol` function
  - Symbols now listed in documentation
- New `{math}` module
  - Contains all math-related functions
  - Variables and function calls directly in math (without hashtag) access this
    module instead of the global scope, but can also access local variables
  - Can be explicitly used in code, e.g. `[#set math.vec(delim: "[")]`
- Delimiter matching in math
   - Any opening delimiters matches any closing one
   - When matched, they automatically scale
   - To prevent scaling, escape them
   - To forcibly match two delimiters, use `lr` function
   - Line breaks may occur between matched delimiters
   - Delimiters may also be unbalanced
   - You can also use the `lr` function to scale the brackets
     (or just one bracket) to a specific size manually
- Multi-line math with alignment
  - The `\` character inserts a line break
  - The `&` character defines an alignment point
  - Alignment points also work for underbraces, vectors, cases, and matrices
  - Multiple alignment points are supported
- More capable math function calls
  - Function calls directly in math can now take code expressions with hashtag
  - They can now also take named arguments
  - Within math function calls, semicolons turn preceding arguments to arrays to
    support matrices: `[$mat(1, 2; 3, 4)$]`
- Arbitrary content in math
  - Text, images, and other arbitrary content can now be embedded in math
  - Math now also supports font fallback to support e.g. CJK and emoji
- More math features
  - New text operators: `op` function, `lim`, `max`, etc.
  - New matrix function: `mat`
  - New n-ary roots with `root` function: `[$root(3, x)$]`
  - New under- and overbraces, -brackets, and -lines
  - New `abs` and `norm` functions
  - New shorthands: `[|`, `|]`, and `||`
  - New `attach` function, overridable attachments with `script` and `limit`
  - Manual spacing in math, with `h`, `thin`, `med`, `thick` and `quad`
  - Symbols and other content may now be used like a function, e.g. `[$zeta(x)$]`
  - Added Fira Math font, removed Noto Sans Math font
  - Support for alternative math fonts through
    `[#show math.formula: set text("Fira Math")]`
- More library improvements
  - New `calc` module, `abs`, `min`, `max`, `even`, `odd` and `mod` moved there
  - New `message` argument on `{assert}` function
  - The `pairs` method on dictionaries now returns an array of length-2 arrays
    instead of taking a closure
  - The method call `{dict.at("key")}` now always fails if `"key"` doesn't exist
    Previously, it was allowed in assignments. Alternatives are `{dict.key = x}`
    and `{dict.insert("key", x)}`.
- Smarter editor functionality
  - Autocompletion for local variables
  - Autocompletion for methods available on a value
  - Autocompletion for symbols and modules
  - Autocompletion for imports
  - Hover over an identifier to see its value(s)
- Further editor improvements
  - New Font menu with previews
  - Single projects may now be shared with share links
  - New dashboard experience if projects are shared with you
  - Keyboard Shortcuts are now listed in the menus and there are more of them
  - New Offline indicator
  - Tooltips for all buttons
  - Improved account protection
  - Moved Status indicator into the error list button
- Further fixes
  - Multiple bug fixes for incremental parser
  - Fixed closure parameter capturing
  - Fixed tons of math bugs
  - Bugfixes for performance, file management, editing reliability
  - Added redirection to the page originally navigated to after signin
